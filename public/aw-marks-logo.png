Since `public/aw-marks-logo.png` is a binary image file, I cannot provide its contents in text format. You'll need to:

1. Create your own logo image
2. Save it as "aw-marks-logo.png"
3. Place it in the "public" folder of your project

There is no code to write for this file as it's an image file, not a code file.
